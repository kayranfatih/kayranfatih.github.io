# Enumeration Scripts 
The original version of these scripts was created by [Mike Czumak][MC]. You can also find these scripts at this [link][Recon].

The main target of these scripts are automate and shorten the process of enumeration. Unlike Mike's scripts, these scripts are a little bit different, more powerfull and customized.  

Enumeration Scripts consist of:
 - HTTP Enumeration 
 - Nmap Port Scan Enumeration
 - SMB Scan Enumeration
